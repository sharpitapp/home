text: "As someone who has recently launched my software engineering career, this training has been instrumental in introducing me to a diverse range of technical and non-technical skills essential for thriving in this industry.This training serves as a missing semester in class because it provided me with mentorship from software engineers who are veterans in this field. Thus, I've learned to adhere to the best practices when it comes to writing software. I now pay careful attention to code quality, maintainability, and scalability, resulting in more readable and maintainable code than before I started this training.The non-technical part of the training is equally important because it taught me how to effectively communicate with my team and listen to their ideas with an open mind. Daily meetings, code reviews, milestone checks, and retrospectives --introduced during the training-- have become integral parts of my workflow. They make work much easier and ensure that my team and I keep track of our goals."
