text: "The training I had was both professionally delivered and interactively fun. I appreciate that we are involved throughout the steps of the training.I personally am grateful that it was a change of mindset and atmosphere on how a series of training is usually done. Aside from information, the trainers/mentors invested time and effort to ensure the topic was grasped and understood correctly.And what I appreciated more in our training was that it had a personal touch. Since we are not crowded, we are not being “mass-informed.” The trainers/mentors assess our understanding and then decide to take a quick illustrational detour to help us understand."
