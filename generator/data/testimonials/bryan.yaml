I appreciate that we are involved throughout the steps of the training.I personally am grateful that it was a change of mindset and atmosphere on how a series of training is usually done. Aside from information, the trainers/mentors invested time and effort to ensure the topic was grasped and understood correctly.And what I appreciated more in our training was that it had a personal touch.
