However, I soon found that the training was designed to make it easy to get started and avoid feeling overwhelmed. The mentors were particularly fantastic; their passion and expertise came through in their teachings, and they were always ready to impart the best practices in the industry based on their professional experiences.Regarding communication, I had always been an introvert and was historically hesitant to share my thoughts and opinions in a group setting. But, thanks to the supportive and encouraging environment provided by the mentors, I found the confidence to speak up and express my ideas without fearing being judged. This valuable personal growth experience will undoubtedly serve me well in my future career.Overall, the training program helped me not only improve my technical skills but also my personal development. It instilled essential values and habits, allowing me to adopt a more productive and proactive mindset. The mentors and culture of the program were instrumental in creating a fun and engaging learning environment, which made the entire experience all the more enjoyable."
