text: "As someone without prior working experience in the industry, this training has been incredibly valuable in learning about things I lacked.For three months, I've learned lessons not covered during my time in school but essential for working in the industry. One crucial aspect was learning about Clean Code and adopting a mindful approach to ensure that my code is easily comprehensible and maintainable by others.Additionally, I gained insights into various methodologies and practices, such as Agile Methodology and the importance of Daily Meetings. This training has encouraged me to sharpen myself for continuous improvement and strive for better synergy and collaboration with my colleagues, ultimately making me a better Software Engineer in technical and non-technical aspects."
