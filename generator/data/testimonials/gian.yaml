text: "I learned a lot from the training series given upon my entry. Learning the basics was emphasized; as Miss Alvie always said, everything would be easier if we had a strong foundation.Topics were also made easier to understand and relatable with the help of other mentors and their years of hands-on industry experience. Aside from technical skills, we were also taught soft skills and values that I still abide by.It was a great experience learning how to improve technically and become a good co-worker and a person as a whole."
