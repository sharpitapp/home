text: "It takes a good leader + good companion/individuals in a community to create a suitable place for learning and growth, whether technical or non-technical.I entered this program thinking it would solely be about developing and improving our technical skills (if ever there are any left after our university days ðŸ˜‚), not knowing that itâ€™s a culmination of both technical and non-technical.Thank you for your patience, time, and effort in teaching us passionately the lessons/skills. Coming from a different career path was a massive leap, and we never felt different.We can say that weâ€™ll be leaving the program happily equipped with invaluable knowledge in programming and improved personalities/habits through the lessons you shared based on personal experiences."
