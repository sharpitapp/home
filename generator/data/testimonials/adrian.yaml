text: "I thank all the mentors for sharing their invaluable knowledge and experience. Our collaboration with the co-trainees is good even if we only know each other online.The training is only a start of our continuous learning not only in the technical but also in the non-technical. I plan to apply the 7 Habits in my life and work slowly.We learned enough to learn more about the technologies out there."
