                                <p>“As someone without prior experience in frontend development, I was initially apprehensive about entering this training. However, I soon found that the training was designed to make it easy to get started and avoid feeling overwhelmed. The mentors were particularly fantastic; their passion and expertise came through in their teachings, and they were always ready to impart the best practices in the industry based on their professional experiences.</p>
                                <p>Regarding communication, I had always been an introvert and was historically hesitant to share my thoughts and opinions in a group setting. But, thanks to the supportive and encouraging environment provided by the mentors, I found the confidence to speak up and express my ideas without fearing being judged. This valuable personal growth experience will undoubtedly serve me well in my future career.</p>
                                <p>Overall, the training program helped me not only improve my technical skills but also my personal development. It instilled essential values and habits, allowing me to adopt a more productive and proactive mindset. The mentors and culture of the program were instrumental in creating a fun and engaging learning environment, which made the entire experience all the more enjoyable.”</p>

                                <p>And what I appreciated more in our training was that it had a personal touch.

                                <p>For three months, I've learned lessons not covered during my time in school but essential for working in the industry. One crucial aspect was learning about Clean Code and adopting a mindful approach to ensure that my code is easily comprehensible and maintainable by others.</p>
                                <p>Additionally, I gained insights into various methodologies and practices, such as Agile Methodology and the importance of Daily Meetings. This training has encouraged me to sharpen myself for continuous improvement and strive for better synergy and collaboration with my colleagues, ultimately making me a better Software Engineer in technical and non-technical aspects.</p>

                                <p>As someone who has recently launched my software engineering career, this training has been instrumental in introducing me to a diverse range of technical and non-technical skills essential for thriving in this industry.</p>
                                <p>This training serves as a missing semester in class because it provided me with mentorship from software engineers who are veterans in this field. Thus, I've learned to adhere to the best practices when it comes to writing software. I now pay careful attention to code quality, maintainability, and scalability, resulting in more readable and maintainable code than before I started this training.</p>
                                <p>The non-technical part of the training is equally important because it taught me how to effectively communicate with my team and listen to their ideas with an open mind. Daily meetings, code reviews, milestone checks, and retrospectives --introduced during the training-- have become integral parts of my workflow. They make work much easier and ensure that my team and I keep track of our goals.</p>
